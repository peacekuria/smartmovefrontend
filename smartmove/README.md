# SmartMove (scaffold)

This directory contains a Vite + React scaffold prepared for Tailwind CSS integration.

Files were created per the user's specification. The `src/` files are present but intentionally left empty (no source code added).

How to use:
1. cd into this folder: `cd smartmove`
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

(If you want, I can now populate `src/` files with the components and pages you described.)
